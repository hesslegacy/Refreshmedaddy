=======================
Helps with the bit of lag that prevents the attack interface from popping up!

In the scripts current state it auto refreshes your page while in the Wasteland every 10-120ish seconds. 

Pros:
  Attack interface pops up way more reliably.
Cons:
  In this version of the script, it can refresh while in combat... 

This is a client side script that will need to be put in your browser.

Chrome users need the Greace Monkey extension and Firefox/OperaGx will need Tamper Monkey

You can find them all on the extension stores for your browsers

After you get them in the browser, just copy paste the script into it and you should be good to go! 

Let me know 1 if you feel a difference and 2 if you have any feedback just toss me a DM in discord or in game message 

Happy Hunting!
